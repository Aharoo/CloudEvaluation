# CloudEvaluationJavaFX
Application for evaluation private clouds by self-developed metrics that was written in JavaFX.  

The parameters by which the assessment is carried out are divided into two groups:  
- main parameters - these are the parameters that are key in the use of private clouds;  
- side parameters - these are parameters that are not key in the use of private clouds, but should be evaluated as additional.  

Evaluation is performed using metrics:

where M is the metric that is calculated, Fij is the characteristic of the j-th repository from the table that belongs to the main group, Sij is the characteristic of the j-th repository from the table that belongs to the side group, Vj is the significance factor from the table.  ]

Visualization of the program is given below:

Thank you for attention and good luck!
